# Presentations Lesson
This lesson is designed to provide some guidance to students who will be demonstrating their software as a team.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Identify qualities of a good presentation, _and_ a bad presentation
- Prepare adequately to present in front of stakeholders
- Create presentation materials as needed

## Lecture 1: Bad Presentation
Present the [Bad Presentation PowerPoint](BadPresentation.pptx). It is purposefully designed to be bad. Read off the slides, don't look at the audience, don't introduce the topic... try to do a bad job. Maybe even switch presenters halfway through without the other presenter knowing they would be presenting.

## Demo: Bad
There is also a piece of software to try and demonstrate - do as little preparation as possible to demonstrate this.

1. Load up [this project](https://replit.com/@JosephMaxwell/Chase-Project#app.js)
    - Fork it if needed
1. Try to run it - it should fail
1. Uncomment line 2 to make it run
1. Don't explain anything about what it does
1. Click "Add a player"
1. Enter gibberish
1. Don't explain what's happening
1. Edit and Delete a player
1. End prematurely and do not ask if anyone has questions

## Discussion
After the "bad" lecture and demo, **ask students what could have gone better**. Talk about some of the differences between a good presentation and a bad presentation.

## Lecture 2: Corrections
Present the [Presentations PowerPoint](Presentations.pptx). It should be slightly better, and emphasize the important lessons learned from the first one.
