# Git & GitHub
This lesson introduces Git and GitHub, and lets students practice using some basic version control processes. It is designed to take ~90 minutes.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Understand the importance of version control
- Define Git and GitHub
- Create a feature branch in a local repository, push to it, and create a pull request

## PowerPoint Presentation
Present the [PowerPoint Presentation](Presentation.pptx). There are notes in the slides.

## Follow-Along: Pull Request
>Note: At this point, teams should have repositories set up where they can make simple, trivial changes for practice purposes.

Walk through [these instructions](PullRequestFollowAlong.md) with the students so that each of them can practice making a change to their repositories.

## Demonstration: Merge Changes
The [Merge Changes](MergeChanges.md) demonstration shows how to deal with merge conflicts when multiple developers are working on the same repository at the same time. It involves some special setup - make sure to import a copy of [this demo repository](https://github.com/hto-projects/merge-demo-start) on GitHub, and use that for the walkthrough. Students do not need to follow along with this - the instructor can simply show it.

## Formative Assessment: Blooket Quiz
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz](https://blooket.com/).
