# Project Ideas & Technologies
Make sure your team chooses a project that is feasible as well as fun! This list is in no way comprehensive; feel free to select something totally different, as long as it is doable!

>_Note: mobile applications are discouraged as project ideas. If a team **really** wants to create a mobile app, they could look into [progressive web apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)._

## Front-End Website
For students who have gone through the [Web 101](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-101) and [Web 102](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-102) material, this may be a good option. This could be a fairly beginner-friendly choice, but it could still allow for some very creative and interesting projects! Here are some ideas:

- Band/Artist website
- Business website
- Sports team website
- School website
- Story/book website
- Personality quiz/calculator maker
- Visual art using [canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)
    - Note: visual art can also be created using [Processing](https://processing.org/)

### Technologies
There are some basic technologies that will definitely be useful:

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

Beyond that, there are some other front-end frameworks that might be worth trying:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Full-Stack Web Application
For students who have gone through the [Web 201](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-201) material, this may be a good option. You can build pretty much anything as a web application these days, and practicing using this paradigm can be incredibly useful! Here are some project ideas:

- To-Do List
- Recipe database
- Blog application
- Forum
- Live chat
- Marketplace (like craigslist)
- Social media (like Twitter)
- Movie/Music reviews (like Letterboxd)
- Jackbox or Kahoot-style game
- Any sort of database

### Technologies
There are several technology stacks for full-stack web development.

- [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack): [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Web 201](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-201) stack: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [EJS](https://ejs.co/) templates, [Replit DB](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/database-faq) (hook up GitHub with Repl)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/about/): [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)

## Console Application
There are many possible console-based applications that a team could try to build, and a variety of technologies use! This option may be good for beginners, but keep in mind that the user interface will be much more sparse than other types of applications. For a text-based application, the project options are somewhat limited... but there are still some possibilities!

- Text-based story or RPG
- Choose your own adventure game
- Calculator (like Wolfram Alpha)

### Technologies
A good number of languages can be used to build a console application, including:

- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/about/)
- JavaScript via [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/api/console.html)

## Video Game
There are a ton of ways to build a video game, and it can be a really fun way to practice programming skills! A video game could be pretty much anything, so the project ideas will be up to the teams. However, there are some technologies that might be helpful:

- Python using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about)
- [Web games](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games)
- [Processing](https://processing.org/) - good for beginners, can also create visualizations!
- C# using [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame)

## API Integration
There are a ton of interesting [API](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/)s that allow developers to integrate their applications with a variety of services. Typically, an API will have libraries for some different programming languages. Here are some possibilities:

- [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)
- [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
- [Other public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

## More Python Possibilities
Here are some other possibilities, specifically based on the [Python 201](https://hylandtechclub.com/py-201) material:

- [Discord bot](https://hylandtechclub.com/py-201/DiscordBot/StudentDesc.html) - make a chat bot or another bot that does something automatically!
- [Web scraper](https://hylandtechclub.com/py-201/WebScraping/StudentDesc.html) - grab data from any website, and use it in your application!
