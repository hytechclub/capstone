# Software Development Capstone
This is material for the Software Development Capstone Hy-Tech Club Course.

## Description
In the capstone course, students will work on one long-term project for the entirety of the semester. There may be some instructor-led lessons scattered throughout the course, but most of the time will be spent working individually or as teams to build software applications.
 
This course will be offered to students that are self-motivated, hard-working, and up for the challenge. Should a student wish to apply for Capstone, the Tech Outreach team will consult with the student's former instructors to determine if the student would be a good fit for the course. If an applicant is not a former Hy-Tech Club student, skill assessments may be given to determine if this is the best option for them.

## Student Skills
Throughout the semester, students should learn and practice the following skills.

### Project Management
Students should be able to manage their own work using Trello. They should plan their project properly, delegate tasks, and complete work as needed.

### Project Scoping
Students should be able to plan around a proper scope for their project. Their projects should be able to be completed within the time allotted for the semester. They should at least have an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) by the end of the semester.

### Teamwork
Students should be able to work effectively as a team. They should communicate using Discord (or another platform), speak up when they need help, and assist each other as needed. They should also treat each other with respect and dignity.

### Self-Guided Work
Students should be able to decide their own path and learn on their own. They can learn from online tutorials, or from their instructors, but it should be up to them to determine their own success.

### Presentation
Students should be able to present their work to stakeholders. They should feel comfortable and confident during their demonstrations, and they should communicate their ideas clearly.

### Technical Knowledge
Students should challenge themselves to learn something new throughout the course of the semester. This does not mean they have to learn an entirely new technology, but they should broaden their knowledge in at least one technological area.
