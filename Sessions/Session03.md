# Session 3
The third session should focus on preparing the teams for actual development work.

**Main Goals**

By the end of the session, each team should have:

- cloned a local version of their repository
- gone through the pull request process in their repository
- decided on the technology stack they will use for the project

Note that these goals may have to be shifted to the next session depending on the timing of this session.

## GitHub Repository Cloning
Though this precedes the actual [GitHub Lesson](../GitHubLesson/README.md), it will help facilitate the next session, where students will be able to practice contributing to their team's repositories.

- Instructors should create repositories for each team within the [HTO Projects GitHub organization](https://github.com/hto-projects)
    - Each repository should start from the [Gitflow Template Repo](https://github.com/hto-projects/gitflow-template)
    - Instructors will need to set up proper protection for the `main` and `develop` branches
- Students should each [make a GitHub account](../GitHubLesson/MakeAGitHubAccount.md)
- Once students have accounts, instructors should add them as collaborators to their team's repository
- Students should then [clone their team's repository](../GitHubLesson/LocalSetup.md)

Instructors should check that each student has a local clone of their repository. It will make things much easier in the next session.

### OPTIONAL Self-Paced Work: Hello World
If students would like to get a head start on learning some GitHub concepts, they can complete the [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) walkthrough.

## GitHub Lesson
The majority of this session will be the [GitHub Lesson](../GitHubLesson/README.md). A break is scheduled into this lesson. Students should be able to practice contributing to their project's repository, and learn more about that process.

## Project Work
After the GitHub lesson, if there is any leftover time, teams can actually begin [doing development work on their projects](ProjectWork.md)!

## Agenda
>Note: the GitHub Lesson includes a scheduled break

| Activity | Time |
