# Session 3
The third session should focus on preparing the teams for actual development work.

**Main Goals**

By the end of the session, each team should have:

- gone through the pull request process in their repository
- decided on the technology stack they will use for the project

Note that these goals may have to be shifted to the next session depending on the timing of this session.

## GitHub Lesson
The majority of this session will be the [GitHub Lesson](../GitHubLesson/README.md). A break is scheduled into this lesson. Students should be able to practice contributing to their project's repository, and learn more about that process.

## Project Work
After the GitHub lesson, if there is any leftover time, teams can actually begin doing development work on their projects!

## Agenda
>Note: the GitHub Lesson includes a scheduled break

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| GitHub Lesson | 90m |
