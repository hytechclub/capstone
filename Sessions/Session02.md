# Session 2
The second session should be an opportunity for teams to decide on a project, and begin planning it out.

**Main Goals**

By the end of the session, each team should have:

- decided on a project idea
- created some designs for the product
- created a Trello board
- have a local clone of their team's GitHub repository
- filled the Trello board To Do list/Backlog with prioritized cards

## User Experience Lesson
Kick off the session with the [User Experience Lesson](../UserExperienceLesson/README.md). Students will hopefully be able to apply some of these concepts in the design of their product.

## Project Decision
Students may already be set on project ideas... or they may be considering a few options. Each team should take this time to decide on a project. Instructors should approve each project idea to ensure that they are all feasible within the semester. When they decide on their project, they should also have a tech stack in mind.

**By the end of this section, each team should have a project decided.**

Teams can submit their project choice via the form on the [homepage](../StudentDesc.md). Responses are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FtA5P88cf68Mx2xGDK1M6aqNnbCBtf5n-Vx6fznXH3E/edit?usp=sharing).

## Trello Boards
Once projects have been decided, each team should create a [Trello Account](https://trello.com/signup). Once those have been created, they should create a new Trello board for their project. The team can customize which lanes they use, but some basic lanes would be:

- **Planning**: for planning documents like design wireframes, or technological architecture
- **To Do**: for a list of possible features or bug fixes, prioritized based on MVP
- **In Progress**: for cards that someone is actively developing
- **Review**: for cards that need to be tested
- **Done**: for cards that are tested and fully complete

[This board](https://trello.com/b/R1EEhM15/hy-tech-club-software-development-template) can be used as a template. Instructors should check that each team has a board created and customized.

## GitHub Repository Cloning
Though this precedes the actual [GitHub Lesson](../GitHubLesson/README.md), it will help facilitate the next session, where students will be able to practice contributing to their team's repositories.

- Instructors should create repositories for each team within the [HTO Projects GitHub organization](https://github.com/hto-projects)
    - Each repository should start from the [Gitflow Template Repo](https://github.com/hto-projects/gitflow-template)
    - Instructors will need to set up proper protection for the `main` and `develop` branches
- Students should each [make a GitHub account](../GitHubLesson/MakeAGitHubAccount.md)
- Once students have accounts, instructors should add them as collaborators to their team's repository
- Students should then [clone their team's repository](../GitHubLesson/LocalSetup.md)

Instructors should check that each student has a local clone of their repository. It will make things much easier in the next session.

### OPTIONAL Self-Paced Work: Hello World
If students would like to get a head start on learning some GitHub concepts, they can complete the [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) walkthrough.

## Design & Backlog
For the remainder of the session, teams should work on planning out their projects. They can collaborate on drawing up wireframes using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [draw.io](https://drawio-app.com/), or good old fashioned pen and paper. They can also add items to their To Do list, and work on prioritizing the list.

At this point, teams should focus mainly on the user-facing design and product features. They may want to begin planning some of the technical details, but [Session Three](Session03.md) provides an opportunity for more of that.
