# Session 2
The second session should be an opportunity for teams to decide on a project, and begin planning it out.

**Main Goals**

By the end of the session, each student should have a team and/or project. Additionally, each team should have:

- decided on a project idea
- created some designs for the product
- created a Trello board (or GitHub Issues board)
- filled the board To Do list/Backlog with prioritized cards (stretch goal)

## User Experience Lesson
Start the session with the [User Experience Lesson](../UserExperienceLesson/README.md). Students will hopefully be able to apply some of these concepts in the design of their product.

## Brainstorming
After the UX lesson, start by presenting some of the [Project Ideas & Technologies](../ProjectIdeasAndTechnologies.md) the students could use. Instructors should talk about their individual experience with different technologies. Theoretically, students could choose to work with any technology they would like; however, it will be much easier for instructors to support them if they use a technology that at least one instructor understands. Instructors should encourage students to choose a stack that will not be too difficult to learn and use. If desired, students can also take this opportunity to learn a new technology.

Have each student try to think of feasible software project ideas. Websites, games, or other basic desktop applications could all work - **try to steer students away from mobile apps though.** Have each student come up with at least three ideas. They can also collaborate with other students during this period - but they should not fully form teams yet.

At the end of this time, have each student share their ideas.

## Team Formation
Have the students form teams.

### Team Member Count
Each new project team should have at least two students, with a maximum of four students. If a student or group of students would like to work on an existing open-source project, that will be allowable as well. The important thing is that each student should be able to practice _collaboration_ in some way.

It may be necessary to adjust the numbers so that everyone has a suitable team.

### Formation Process
If students do not know anybody, it may be necessary to place students on teams. _Note that throughout the course of the semester, each student will likely take on almost all of the software development team roles in some capacity; however, if a student has more interest in one specific role, they can focus their efforts there._ Instructors should approve each team.

Put up a countdown timer to make sure all teams form in a timely fashion.

## Project Decision
Students may already be set on project ideas... or they may be considering a few options. Each team should take this time to decide on a project. Instructors should approve each project idea to ensure that they are all feasible within the semester. When they decide on their project, they should also have a tech stack in mind.

**By the end of this section, each team should have a project decided.**

Teams can submit their project choice via the form on the [homepage](../StudentDesc.md). Responses are available [here](https://hylandsw-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/techoutreachteam_hyland_com/IQBN0U6J_7O-SL7gXuOuo9HGAYlz1m2zGXilE80NYGfjd1w?e=qyqiiV).

>_NOTE: Instructors should create GitHub repositories for each project once the projects have been decided_

## Trello Boards / GitHub Issues
Once projects have been decided, each team should create a board. They can do this with Trello by creating a [Trello Account](https://trello.com/signup). They can also use GitHub issues. The team can customize which lanes they use, but some basic lanes would be:

- **Planning**: for planning documents like design wireframes, or technological architecture
- **To Do**: for a list of possible features or bug fixes, prioritized based on MVP
- **In Progress**: for cards that someone is actively developing
- **Review**: for cards that need to be tested
- **Done**: for cards that are tested and fully complete

[This Trello board](https://trello.com/b/R1EEhM15/hy-tech-club-software-development-template) can be used as a template. Instructors should check that each team has a board created and customized.

## Design & Backlog
For the remainder of the session, teams should work on planning out their projects. They can collaborate on drawing up wireframes using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [draw.io](https://drawio-app.com/), or good old fashioned pen and paper. They can also add items to their To Do list, and work on prioritizing the list.

At this point, teams should focus mainly on the user-facing design and product features. They may also want to work on determining which technologies/frameworks to use.
