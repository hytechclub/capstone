# Session 2
The second session should be an opportunity for teams to decide on a project, and begin planning it out.

**Main Goals**

By the end of the session, each team should have:

- decided on a project idea
- created some designs for the product
- created a Trello board
- filled the Trello board To Do list/Backlog with prioritized cards

## User Experience Lesson
Kick off the session with the [User Experience Lesson](../UserExperienceLesson/README.md). Students will hopefully be able to apply some of these concepts in the design of their product.

## Project Decision
Each team should take some time to decide on a project. Instructors should approve each project idea to ensure that they are all feasible within the semester.

**By the end of this section, each team should have a project decided.**

## Trello Boards
Once projects have been decided, each team should create a [Trello Account](https://trello.com/signup). Once those have been created, they should create a new Trello board for their project. The team can customize which lanes they use, but some basic lanes would be:

- **Planning**: for planning documents like design wireframes, or technological architecture
- **To Do**: for a list of possible features or bug fixes, prioritized based on MVP
- **In Progress**: for cards that someone is working on
- **Review**: for cards that need to be tested
- **Done**: for cards that are tested and fully complete

[This board](https://trello.com/b/R1EEhM15/hy-tech-club-software-development-template) can be used as a template. Instructors should check that each team has a board created and customized.

## GitHub Repository Cloning
Instructors will have to create repositories for each team based on their project. They will have to setup proper branch protections for the `main` and `develop` branches. Once students have created GitHub accounts, they should be added as collaborators in their team's repository. Students should also clone their team's repository locally, so it is ready to go. In the next session, during the [GitHub Lesson](../GitHubLesson/README.md), students will be able to practice contributing to their team's repositories. 

### Optional Self-Paced Work: Hello World

## Design & Backlog
For the remainder of the session, teams should work on planning out their projects. They can collaborate on drawing up wireframes using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [draw.io](https://drawio-app.com/), or good old fashioned pen and paper. They can also add items to their To Do list, and work on prioritizing the list.

At this point, teams should focus mainly on the user-facing design and product features. They may want to begin planning some of the technical details, but [Session Three](Session03.md) provides an opportunity for more of that.
