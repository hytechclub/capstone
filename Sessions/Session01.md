# Session 1
The opening session should mostly serve to acclimate the students with the idea of the course, and allow them to form their teams.

## Icebreaker Activities
There should be a significant focus on the icebreakers for this course. Students will be working together on teams, so it is important that they get to know each other a little bit. It may be worth facilitating multiple activities to start building camaraderie.

### Ideas
Below are some ideas for potential icebreaker activities.

- Snowball Fight: Have each student write down a question on a piece of paper, and then crumple it up into a ball. Students should then throw the "snowballs" at each other for a minute. After the minute, students should pick up the nearest snowball. Go around the room and have each student answer the question from their snowball.
- [Drawphone](https://drawphone.tannerkrewson.com/): Telephone with pictures (like Telestrations)
- [Drawasaurus](https://www.drawasaurus.org/): Online Pictionary
- [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/): Fun quiz games (can be tangentially relevant to software development; account required)
- [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/): Other quizzes (bigger selection of quizzes)

It may also be helpful to do an icebreaker activity at the beginning of each session.

## Course Procedures Overview
Take some time to go over the purpose of the course. Show the basic schedule so they know about the important milestones and lessons throughout the semester. Explain that this is unlike other Hy-Tech Club courses, and it will require them to make their own work. Try to motivate the students and get them excited about the prospect of building a software application with a team.

After the basic rundown, go over [Discord use](https://hylandtechclub.com/DiscordUse). Try to make sure each student joins the Discord server. Note that they are not required to use Discord, but it has the potential to be very helpful for this course.

## Software Development Lesson
Present the [Software Development Teams & Processes Lesson](../SoftwareDevTeamsLesson/README.md).

## Brainstorming
Have each student try to think of feasible software project ideas. Websites, games, or other basic desktop applications could all work - try to steer students away from mobile apps though. Have each student come up with at least three ideas. They can also collaborate with other students during this period - but they should not fully form teams yet.

At the end of this time, have each student share their ideas.

## Team Formation
Have the students form teams. Each team should have at least two students, with a maximum of four students. It may be necessary to adjust the numbers so that everyone has a suitable team. If students do not know anybody, it may be necessary to place students on teams.

**By the end of the session, teams should be fully formed.**

## Remaining Time
If teams have all been formed before the end of the session, the remaining time can be used to do another icebreaker activity.
